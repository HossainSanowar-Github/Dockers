Data was gathered from photos of authentic and counterfeit banknote-like specimens. A standard industrial camera used for print inspection was used for digitisation. The final picture resolution is 400x400 pixels. Due to the object lens and the researched object's distance, grayscale images with a resolution of around 660 dpi were captured. The Wavelet Transform tool was used to extract picture characteristics.
